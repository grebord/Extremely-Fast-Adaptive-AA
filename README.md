# LXAA

This in an extremely efficient AA Shader for Reshade, providing great image quality with minimal overhead.
It is faster than any other technique I have tested, and unlike many others it causes minimal to no blurring (depending on settings).

Originally based on Timothy Lottes' Console FXAA v3, although the code has changed substantially by now.

Try it out!
